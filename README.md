## Game Field CAD Files

These links will take you to the separate Onshape documents for the game fields and tech station. The Partial Game Field is for teams to be able to set up a simplified section of the court.  The Tech Station will enable teams to design the RVR Passenger Bay to align with the Sphero's coming off of the Tech Station.

These links are view-only, which will still allow teams to get measurements. To download, you must have an (or sign up for a free) OnShape account. While logged in, click the three lines for the menu in the top left and copy the workspace to your account.
